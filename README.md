# TeknoParrot Web Installer

## Usage
Run TPBootstrapper.exe and download cores.

## Compiling
Project should load in any version of Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code. You need .NET 8 installed.

Prerequisites are:
- Octokit.NET
- Autoupdater.NET
- Ookii.Dialogs

These could be replaced easily with custom made solutions but I decided not to reinvent the wheel.
